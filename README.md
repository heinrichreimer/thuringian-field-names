# üèûÔ∏è thuringian-field-names

Explorer for the Thuringian Field Name Archive.

_The project is developed as part of the [Client-side web applications](https://mht.uzi.uni-halle.de/client-seitige-web-anwendungen/) lecture at [Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg](https://uni-halle.de)._

## Usage

The field name explorer is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app, built and run with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
Note that you must specify [API credentials](#api-credentials) for the app to work.

### Run

Run the app locally in development mode (page reloads on edits):

```shell script
yarn start

```

Now you use the app from [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser

### Test

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode:

```shell script
yarn test

```

Launch the integration test suite:

```shell script
yarn cypress open

```

For more information, see the [`cypress`](cypress) directory.

### Bundle

Build the app for production:

```shell script
yarn build

```

You'll find the bundled and optimized app in the `build` folder, ready for deployment.

### API credentials

For accessing the field name API, you must specify username and password to the backend API.
Create a file `.env.local` with the following content (replace `user` and `pass` with your credentials):

```properties
REACT_APP_API_USERNAME=user
REACT_APP_API_PASSWORD=pass
```

The app won't work without specifying API credentials.
Note that you need to [restart](#run) the development server for changes to take effect.
