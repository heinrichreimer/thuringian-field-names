# End-to-end tests

We use the [Cypress](https://cypress.io) end-to-end test runner for testing the app user interface.
You can find the individual integration tests in the [`integration`](integration) directory.

## Automated tests

Run all Cypress tests automatically:

```shell script
yarn test
```

## Interactive tests

Launch the interactive Cypress test runner:

```shell script
yarn test-gui
```
